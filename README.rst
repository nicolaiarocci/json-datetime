JSON-datetime allows for proper decoding of datetime values contained in JSON
streams.

The problem
-----------
The JSON standard RFC 4627 does not
support datetime types. These are usually represented as strings and Python 
decoders end up decoding them as such. Consider the following example:

.. code-block:: python

    import simplejson as json

    >>> test = '{"name": "John Doe", "born": "Thu, 1 Mar 2012 10:00:49 UTC"}'
    >>> json.loads(test)

As you can see, in the resulting dictionary ``born`` is still a string.

The solution
------------
JSON-datetime is a very simple wrapper around Python simplejson ``loads`` 
method. It decodes datetime values contained in JSON strings: 

.. code-block:: python

    import jsondatetime as json

    >>> test = '{"name": "John Doe", "born": "Thu, 1 Mar 2012 10:00:49 UTC"}'
    >>> json.loads(test)
    {'name': 'John Doe', 'born': datetime.datetime(2012, 3, 1, 10, 0 ,49)}

Strings are parsed using ``dateutil.parser.parse`` which is fairly flexible for
common datetime formats

Custom parsing
--------------
Being just a wrapper around the ``loads`` method, you can still use all the
standard ``loads`` arguments, ``object_hook`` included. This means that you can
still perform custom parsing of your inbound JSON stream.

Installation
------------
``pip install json-datetime``
